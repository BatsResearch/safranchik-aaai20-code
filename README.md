# Weakly Supervised Sequence Tagging from Noisy Rules

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of our experiments up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

Please clone and download [wiser](https://github.com/BatsResearch/wiser), our framework for training weakly supervising deep sequence taggers for named entity recognition tasks.

To get the code for generative models and other rule-aggregation methods, download the latest version of [ner-sandbox](https://https://github.com/BatsResearch/ner-sandbox).

### Installing

To download the dependencies required to run our experiments, run

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
